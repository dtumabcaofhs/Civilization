#### 👋 Introduction
Welcome to **Civilization**! In this video game, you exist in The World. You are granted godly, society-shaping powers. From ~~the~~ ~~heavens~~ wherever you are, you oversee a human village.
Whether you let them starve to death or shape them into the greatest empire since 
the Galactic Empire, what happens to them is _your_ call.
#### 🧭 How To Navigate Civilization's UI
* 🗺️ The 81 squares on the left side of the UI make up 🗺️ The World View, which consists of interactive "tiles" of The World that you can manipulate.
* 🎛️ The buttons on the right side of the UI make up the 🎛️ Place Controls, 
which consists of buttons that allow you to manipulate 🗺️ The World View to your vision.
* ℹ️ The text between those makes up the ℹ️ Stat-Sheet, which details information
about your civilization, its world, and your selected place type.
